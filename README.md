# MedGermDB: a seed germination database for characteristic species of Mediterranean habitats
MedGermDB is a database of seed germination ecology for species of the Mediterranean Basin. It contains data on >200 plant species, obtained from >100 published references. The data is in the form of germination proportions recorded under experimental combinations of temperature, light, scarification and stratification.

This repository stores the information related to the publication [*MedGermDB: a seed germination database for characteristic species of Mediterranean habitats*](https://doi.org/.....), including the raw datasets (Germination Database File, Taxa File, Habitat File), the scripts to perform the shiny app that can be used to visualize the database (link).

# Contents
The following materials are available in this repository:
- data: the three files that compound MedGermDB in csv format, and files using to build the shiny app.
- doc: manuscript and appendix.
- results: output of the R scripts, including files needed to create and run the app.
- src: scripts in R language used to clean data, and build the MedGermDB app data.
